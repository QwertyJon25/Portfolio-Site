## Description 

Created with React.js as a frontend framework. Featuring React Router and CSS for styling.

When I first began programming, I only knew how to use HTML and CSS. After my graduation from Flatiron School I wanted to come back to this application and rework it into a React app, as well as add in some JS functionality.
