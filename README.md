## Description

Created with React.js as a frontend framework, Active Record as an ORM, and Sinatra as a backend framework. Featuring React Router and CSS for styling.

This application was my third semester project during my time at Flatiron School. Users can view a list of dogs rendered from associated data from a custom backend database, and all entries feature full CRUD capability.
